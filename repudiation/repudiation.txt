- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version is better at preventing repudiation than the insecure version.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

The initial insecure version did not log that a certain user sent a certain 
message. This would make it much more difficult to determine who took a malicious 
action after the fact since the logs are not sufficient. This is in stark contrast
to the secure version, which does have proper logging.

Additional security mechanisms could take the form of additional logging that 
gives technical staff a more granular view of what actions the user is taking
on the site. For example, was the send successful?
