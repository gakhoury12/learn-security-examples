- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

The vulnerability in this code is that the insecure version of the code does not catch
errors that arise when an ID is queried from the database. This could lead to a 
denial of service attack where a malicious actor purposefuly submits input that 
will lead to an error, crashing the server. This could be done many times over 
using VPNs that make the internet traffic appear to be coming from different sources,
causing the service to come to a grinding halt. The secure version has proper
error checking so that attacks like this would not bring down an entire instance
of the server. 

To further prevent such attacks, we could implement capchas that help distinguish
real users from bots. This would make it much harder to launch at attack at the
scale that would cause system failure.
