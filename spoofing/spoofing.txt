Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
    The vulnerability in this case happens when a script is submitted as an input on the front end website.
    This allows a user to submit malicious code into a browser input and perform a Javascript injection attack.
    They can add links to a webpage and trick normal users to click on them. This would expose the user to a host
    of different vulnerabilities as this malicious page is in no way controlled by us the developers. 
    This violates the CIA property of integrity, because we can no longer be sure that our data is trustworthy and
    untampered with.
